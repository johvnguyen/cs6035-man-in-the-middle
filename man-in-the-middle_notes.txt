1. Basic knowledge of Networking TCP, DNS, HTTP calls.
	TCP: Architecture agnostic netowrk protocol for generic communications.
		Historically, only machines of the same architecture could speak with each other. That is stupid, so we made TCP/IP language agnostic.
		Has 4 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Application
		OSI is an adjacent model/competitor of TCP that is better but less adopted.
		Has receipts and is slower than UDP.
		
	DNS: A network protocol used for domain to ip address mapping.
		Communications over the interent is handled through ip addresses, not domain names. So there must be a way to map the strings of domain names to the true IP address.
			Analogy: We do not remember the phone numbers of our friends, we use the Contacts app to route friend names to their contact information.
		Note: DNS includes webservices such as node endpoints, not just webpages.
		IP address may be stored in cache and not need to use DNS service if website was recently visited.
			The device that caches the IP address is called the stub resolver.
		Suppose the stub resolver reaches out to a DNS service to find the IP address of a specific domain. The DNS service may not know the IP address, and will query other DNS services for the information.
			There are "root" DNS services that forward DNS requests to the appropriate DNS service. 
			Each DNS service handles one/multiple level(s) of the domain and forwards the remaining domain name to another service.
		Ex. Consider the domain name: academy.networkchuck.com
			".com" <- Top level domain
			".networkchuck" <- Second level domain
			"academy" <- Third level domain
		DNS Service is insecure -- unencrypted and uses port 53.
			"DNS spoofing"
		Securing a connection: "DNS over HTTPS" (DoH)
			HTTPS is secure.
		DNS Records: A databse stored on a computer that maintains a domain name to ip address mapping
		
	HTTP calls: A network protocol that governs how computers talk to each other.
		"Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"
		3 objects of interest:
			Client (Local) - The machine that is trying to get data.
			Router - Forwards the Client to the Service
			Service (Remote) - The machine which might contain data the Client wants.
				Sends error/status code if it does not have the data the Client wants.
		Status Codes:
			1xx: Informational
			2xx: Success
				Ex. 200 is success
			3xx: Redirection
			4xx: Client Error
				Ex: 404 Error
			5xx: Sercer Error
		Consider the sturcture of a HTTP Request:
			Every HTTP request has a header of metadata, and then a body of the actual data of interest.
			Structure:
				Start Line
					Method/Target/Version info
				Header(s)
				Body
		HTTP Response Structure
			Structure:
				Start Line
					Version/Status Code/Status Text
				Headers
				Body
		HTTP: Stateless
		Based on TCP/IP
		3 parts of each message: Start Line/Headers/Body (for both Request and Repsonse messages)
		There are many requests associated with a single action.	
		
2. Basics of Internet Relay Chat:
	Legacy real time communication protocol.
	First widely accepted, open source communication method.
	Still used by hackers.
	Standard client/server setup.
		Anyone connected to the server is relayed data to each other.
		Anyone can set up a server.
	Somewhat anonymous.
	SSL used to secure sockets.
	
3. What nslookup or dig commands via the command line and what they do with websites.
	dig and nslookup are used to query the DNS for information about domain names/ip addresses.
	They provide the same information, but they work differently.
		Can be used to validate each other
		Inconsistent data obtained from dig and nslookup is interesting.
	dig is written using the basic C libraries
	nslookup uses internal commands.
	
4. Basic python programming with the pyshark python programming language.
	Pyshark includes Scapy, which I used for Data Viz project.
	It looks easy enough.
5. Knowledge of how to examine a pcap in wireshark.
	You drop it into the app.
6. Familiarity with how to use the website cyberchef may help also for some tasks.
	Cyberchef
		Used to encode/decode stirngs.
		Can be used to parse/write binary data to/from plaintext
			Its configurable Wireshark with an Apache license
		Holy fuck it has linting.
		Just look up CyberChef recipes other people have created.
